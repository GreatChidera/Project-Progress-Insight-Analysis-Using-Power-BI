### Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing and tracking the progress of various projects using Power BI. It aims to improve project transparency, monitor timelines, evaluate budget performance, and support data-driven decision-making by stakeholders.

### Objectives
- To track project progress across multiple tasks and phases, enabling timely identification of delays or underperformance.  
- To monitor task completion rates and team performance, supporting better workload distribution and accountability.  
- To analyze budget allocation and actual expenditure, helping stakeholders manage resources effectively and avoid cost overruns.  
- To visualize project timelines against expected delivery dates, enhancing planning, forecasting, and milestone tracking.  
- To provide stakeholders with actionable insights through interactive reports for improved decision-making and project optimization.
### Process
1. Data Collection:  
   Gathered raw project data including task status, timelines, budget, expenditure, and team assignments from source files such as Excel spreadsheets.

2. Data Cleaning & Transformation:  
   Used Power Query in Power BI to clean and transform the data — handling missing values, ensuring correct data types, and creating relationships between tables (e.g., calendar and project tables).

3. Modeling:  
   Established a data model linking project details, tasks, and time dimensions. Created DAX measures for KPIs such as task completion rate, budget variance, and duration metrics.

4. Visualization:  
   Built interactive visuals using Power BI, including Gantt-style timeline views, budget tracking charts, task completion stats, and progress indicators for each project and team member.

5. Interactivity & Filtering:  
   Added slicers and filters for dynamic analysis by year, team member, project status, and priority, allowing stakeholders to drill into specifics.
### Tools
- Microsoft Power BI: For data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard creation.  
- Microsoft Excel: For initial data entry, structuring, and cleaning.  
- Power Query: For transforming and preparing data within Power BI.  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating custom measures and KPIs.
### Key Insights
- There is noticeable variation in project progress across different tasks, indicating uneven workload distribution and potential delays in specific areas.
- Budget tracking reveals some projects are exceeding their allocated funds while others remain under budget, highlighting the need for improved financial oversight.
- High-priority tasks tend to have slower progress rates, suggesting resource constraints or challenges that require immediate intervention.
- The task status breakdown helps identify stalled or at-risk activities, enabling timely corrective actions.
- Completion dates compared to due dates show a trend of delays in certain projects, emphasizing the importance of better schedule management.
- Analysis of assigned team members workloads suggests opportunities to rebalance responsibilities for enhanced efficiency.
- Comments and feedback data provide qualitative insights that can inform process improvements and stakeholder communication.
- Overall, the dashboard supports proactive project monitoring, risk identification, and decision-making to ensure timely and within-budget delivery.
### Challenges
- Data Cleaning Issues: The raw data had missing values and inconsistencies that required extensive cleaning.
- Complex DAX Calculations: Creating accurate measures like project progress and budget variance was initially challenging.
- Dashboard Design Decisions: Structuring the visuals to clearly communicate insights without clutter took multiple iterations.
- Time Management: Balancing learning and building the project under limited time was tough
### Solutions
- Used Power BI’s Power Query editor to clean and transform the data effectively.
- Studied and practiced DAX functions to build accurate and reusable measures.
- Researched best practices in dashboard layout and kept refining the design based on feedback.
- Applied sync slicers and cross-filtering options to ensure filters worked seamlessly.
- Scheduled focused sessions to complete tasks in manageable chunks and stay on track.
